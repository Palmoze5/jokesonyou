### jokesOnYou
## An app for aspiring comedians to make, update, view and delete their jokes.
I want to do a JOKES API for ONE user (One to Many) - it would be conceptualized as an API for beginner level comedians who want to CREATE a joke or list of jokes, to READ (so they could refer and reflect), UPDATE (if they felt the joke needed a little more pizzazz or different angle) and DELETE (if they thought the joke didn’t get them any laughs when told in front of family/friends, strangers or small shows). I recently came up with the idea after reading a chapter in a book
titled, 'The Comedy Bible', by Judy Carter. I like to crack jokes, because it's not only a
stress reliever, but it also puts people around me in good spirits, motivated and productive
for their moments. I may not be the best joker, but I am a student, and I love learning what
makes people laugh and what doesn't. Which is why before this project, I was informally keeping
tabs on what things I posted on slack received emojis or text responses and what did not. I also
kept tabs on things that I said vocally in class that either got a roar from my peers or absolutely crickets.
